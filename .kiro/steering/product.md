# Product Overview

**Jisaku (自作)** is a personal, offline-first PWA for researching and documenting kanji through hands-on creation rather than passive consumption.

## Core Capabilities

- **Kanji research and documentation** — Deep etymology, meanings, readings, classifications, stroke analysis
- **Component analysis** — Track building blocks, radicals, visual forms, and positional occurrences
- **Vocabulary integration** — Document kanji combinations with readings and JLPT levels
- **Offline-first architecture** — All data stored locally in SQLite (browser-based via sql.js)
- **Data ownership** — Full export/import control via SQLite database files

## Target Use Cases

- **Research-driven learning** — Build understanding through synthesis of multiple sources
- **Personal reference building** — Create custom dictionary entries reflecting individual insights
- **Component pattern discovery** — Analyze how radicals and sub-components combine and transform
- **Etymology documentation** — Track historical development and semantic evolution

## Value Proposition

Learning happens through creation, not consumption. Instead of reading pre-made dictionary entries, users research kanji across sources and synthesize their own understanding through structured documentation. The tool supports this process with:

- Structured fields for systematic research (classifications, etymology, notes)
- Component tracking to understand compositional patterns
- Vocabulary examples showing practical usage
- Complete data portability and offline capability
