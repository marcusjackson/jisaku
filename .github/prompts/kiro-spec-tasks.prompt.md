# Implementation Tasks Generator

<background_information>

- **Mission**: Generate detailed, actionable implementation tasks that translate technical design into executable work items
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All requirements mapped to specific tasks
  - Tasks properly sized (1-3 hours each)
  - Clear task progression with proper hierarchy
  - Natural language descriptions focused on capabilities
    </background_information>

<instructions>
## Core Task
Generate implementation tasks for feature **$1** based on approved requirements and design.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Load Context

**Read all necessary context**:

- `.kiro/specs/$1/spec.json`, `requirements.md`, `design.md`
- `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` (if exists, for merge mode)
- **Entire `.kiro/steering/` directory** for complete project memory

**Approval Model**:

- Running this prompt constitutes implicit approval of requirements and design
- Spec.json will be updated to mark both phases as approved

### Step 2: Generate Implementation Tasks

**Load generation rules and template**:

- Read `.kiro/settings/rules/tasks-generation.md` for principles
- If sequential mode is **false**: Read `.kiro/settings/rules/tasks-parallel-analysis.md` for parallel judgement criteria
- Read `.kiro/settings/templates/specs/tasks.md` for format (supports `(P)` markers)

**Generate task list following all rules**:

- Use language specified in spec.json
- Map all requirements to tasks and list numeric requirement IDs only (comma-separated) without extra narration, descriptive suffixes, parentheses, translations, or free-form labels
- Ensure all design components included
- Verify task progression is logical and incremental
- Collapse single-subtask structures by promoting them to major tasks and keep container summaries concise
- Apply `(P)` markers to tasks that satisfy parallel criteria (omit markers when sequential mode is requested)
- Mark optional acceptance-criteria-focused test coverage subtasks with `- [ ]*` only when deferrable post-MVP
- If existing tasks.md found, merge with new content

**Validate File Size and Split if Necessary**:

- Count total lines of generated task content (excluding blank lines)
- **If content would exceed 600 lines**:
  1. Create splitting plan by logical grouping:
     - Common splits: `tasks-setup.md`, `tasks-core.md`, `tasks-integration.md`, `tasks-testing.md`
     - Or by layer: `tasks-frontend.md`, `tasks-backend.md`, `tasks-infrastructure.md`
     - Or by feature area based on design component groups
  2. Create `tasks.md` as index:
     - Include task execution order and dependencies
     - List all task document parts with descriptions
     - Provide navigation links to all parts
     - Show high-level progress tracking structure
  3. Split tasks into themed files:
     - Each file MUST start with cross-references to other task files
     - Maintain sequential numbering across files (e.g., tasks-setup.md has 1-5, tasks-core.md has 6-12)
     - Include clear "Prerequisites" section if tasks depend on other files
     - Keep logically related tasks together
  4. Format all files with prettier/markdown formatter
  5. Verify no single file exceeds 600 lines after formatting
- **If single file acceptable** (under 600 lines):
  1. Write to `tasks.md` and format
  2. Re-check after formatting; split if needed

### Step 3: Finalize

**Write and update**:

- Create/update `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` (and parts if split)
- Update spec.json metadata:
  - Set `phase: "tasks-generated"`
  - Set `approvals.tasks.generated: true, approved: false`
  - Set `approvals.requirements.approved: true`
  - Set `approvals.design.approved: true`
  - If tasks split, add `task_files: ["tasks.md", "tasks-setup.md", ...]` array
  - Update `updated_at` timestamp

## Critical Constraints

- **Follow rules strictly**: All principles in tasks-generation.md are mandatory
- **Natural Language**: Describe what to do, not code structure details
- **Complete Coverage**: ALL requirements must map to tasks
- **Maximum 2 Levels**: Major tasks and sub-tasks only (no deeper nesting)
- **Sequential Numbering**: Major tasks increment (1, 2, 3...), never repeat
- **Task Integration**: Every task must connect to the system (no orphaned work)
  </instructions>

## Tool Guidance

- **Read first**: Load all context, rules, and templates before generation
- **Write last**: Generate tasks.md only after complete analysis and verification

## Output Description

Provide brief summary in the language specified in spec.json:

1. **Status**: Confirm tasks generated at `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md` (XXX lines) [+ parts if split]
2. **Task Summary**:
   - Total: X major tasks, Y sub-tasks
   - All Z requirements covered
   - Average task size: 1-3 hours per sub-task
3. **File Organization** (if split): How tasks were grouped into multiple files
4. **Quality Validation**:
   - ✅ All requirements mapped to tasks
   - ✅ Task dependencies verified
   - ✅ Testing tasks included
   - ✅ All files under 600 lines
5. **Next Action**: Review task files and proceed when ready

**Format**: Concise (under 200 words)

## Safety & Fallback

### Error Scenarios

**Missing Requirements or Design**:

- **Stop Execution**: Both documents must exist
- **User Message**: "Missing requirements.md or design.md at `.kiro/specs/$1/`"
- **Suggested Action**: "Complete requirements and design phases first"

**Incomplete Requirements Coverage**:

- **Warning**: "Not all requirements mapped to tasks. Review coverage."
- **User Action Required**: Confirm intentional gaps or regenerate tasks

**Template/Rules Missing**:

- **User Message**: "Template or rules files missing in `.kiro/settings/`"
- **Fallback**: Use inline basic structure with warning
- **Suggested Action**: "Check repository setup or restore template files"
- **Missing Numeric Requirement IDs**:
  - **Stop Execution**: All requirements in requirements.md MUST have numeric IDs. If any requirement lacks a numeric ID, stop and request that requirements.md be fixed before generating tasks.

### Next Phase: Implementation

**Before Starting Implementation**:

- **IMPORTANT**: Clear conversation history and free up context before running `/kiro-spec-impl`
- This applies when starting first task OR switching between tasks
- Fresh context ensures clean state and proper task focus

**If Tasks Approved**:

- Execute specific task: `/kiro-spec-impl $1 1.1` (recommended: clear context between each task)
- Execute multiple tasks: `/kiro-spec-impl $1 1.1,1.2` (use cautiously, clear context between tasks)
- Without arguments: `/kiro-spec-impl $1` (executes all pending tasks - NOT recommended due to context bloat)

**If Modifications Needed**:

- Provide feedback and re-run `/kiro-spec-tasks $1`
- Existing tasks used as reference (merge mode)

**Note**: The implementation phase will guide you through executing tasks with appropriate context and validation.
